<!-- ## Currently -->

<!-- I am a post-doctoral associate working with professor [Peter Kang](https://pkkang.com/home) at the university of Minnesota. My research centers on the interface between physical and data sciences, aiming at improving fundamental understanding and characterizing uncertainty of flow, transport, and reaction in hydrological systems. I combine theoretical and computaional approaches such as fluid dynamics, extreme value theory, Bayesian anlysis, fractals, stochastic modeling, deep learning, and computational fluid mechanics.  -->

<!-- I currently study anomalous transport and mixing-induced reaction in rough fractures.  -->

<!-- ### Specialized in

Laws of motion, gravitation, minting coins, disliking [Robert Hooke](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hooke)


### Research interests

Cooling, power series, optics, alchemy, planetary motions, apples.
