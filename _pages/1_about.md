I am a post-doctoral associate in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. I earned my Ph.D in 2016 from the Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
<!-- I also hold a B.S. and M.S. in Civil Engineering from Yonsei University (South Korea).  -->
My Ph.D. thesis was on developing computationally efficient subsurface flow models and inverse modeling methods to characterize hydrogeological parameters. 

<!-- My research centers on model-data fusion, combining process-based models with data-driven methods, to improve predictive capability and understanding of hydrogeological systems. I currently study anomalous and reactive transport in fractured hydrogelogic media. -->

<!-- My research centers on model-data fusion, combining process-based models with data-driven methods, to improve predictive capability and understanding of hydrogeological systems.  -->

My research centers on the integration of physical and data sciences, aiming at improving fundamental understanding and predictive capability of hydrogeological systems. I combine theoretical and computational approaches such as extreme value theory, fractals, Bayesian analysis, stochastic modeling, machine learning, and computational fluid dynamics.
