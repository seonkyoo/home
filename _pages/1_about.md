I am a postdoctoral associate in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. 

My research centers on model-data fusion, combining process-based models with data-driven methods, to improve predictive capability and understanding of hydrogeological systems. I am currently working on inverse problems for subsurface characterization and anomalous transport in fractured media.

I received my Ph.D. from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2016. My PhD thesis was on developing computationally efficient subsurface flow models and inverse modeling methods to characterize hydrogeological parameters.
