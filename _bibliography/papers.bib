abstract = "Predicting variable-density flow and transport in aquifers is critical for the management of many coastal saline aquifers. Accurate characterization of hydrogeological parameters is critical for prediction, and the characterization is often conducted by assimilating data into models. However, few studies have investigated the underlying physics controlling the value-of-information (VOI) of data for aquifer characterization. In this study, we show how a greater understanding of the underlying physics controlling pressure and concentration data coupling can lead to improved characterization. In variable-density flow, the key physics that controls the VOI of pressure and concentration data is the non-linear coupling between flow and transport via fluid density which causes the pressure field to experience transient changes according to the evolution of salinity distribution. We first demonstrate the coupling between pressure and concentration data using information theory, and then systematically investigate how the variable-density flow impacts the VOI of these data in relation to permeability estimation. Using an ensemble Kalman filter, we estimate the permeability field of saline aquifer systems in two scenarios of data usage: pressure data only, and pressure and concentration data jointly. This study demonstrates that, regardless of the data usage scenario, the maximum VOI of data is obtained when free convection and forced convection are balanced. We further show that the advantage of joint inversion of pressure and concentration data decreases as the coupling effect between flow and transport increases. Finally, we study how the level of permeability field heterogeneity affects the coupling, which in turn controls VOI of pressure and concentration data."

  abstract="The injection and storage of freshwater in saline aquifers for the purpose of managed aquifer recharge is an important technology that can help ensure sustainable water resources. As a result of the density difference between the injected freshwater and ambient saline groundwater, the pressure field is coupled to the spatial salinity distribution, and therefore experiences transient changes. The effect of variable density can be quantified by the mixed convection ratio, which is a ratio between the strength of two convection processes: free convection due to the density differences and forced convection due to hydraulic gradients. We combine a density-dependent flow and transport simulator with an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to analyze the effects of freshwater injection rates on the value-of-information of transient pressure data for saline aquifer characterization. The EnKF is applied to sequentially estimate heterogeneous aquifer permeability fields using real-time pressure data. The performance of the permeability estimation is analyzed in terms of the accuracy and the uncertainty of the estimated permeability fields as well as the predictability of breakthrough curve arrival times in a realistic push-pull setting. This study demonstrates that injecting fluids at a rate that balances the two characteristic convections can maximize the value of pressure data for saline aquifer characterization."

  abstract="Subsurface flow modeling is an indispensable task for reservoir management, but the associated computational cost is burdensome because of model complexity and the fact that many simulation runs are required for its applications such as production optimization, uncertainty quantification, and history matching. To relieve the computational burden in reservoir flow modeling, a reduced-order modeling procedure based on hyper-reduction is presented. The procedure consists of three components: state reduction, constraint reduction, and nonlinearity treatment. State reduction based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is considered, and the impact of state reduction, with different strategies for collecting snapshots, on accuracy and predictability is investigated. Petrov--Galerkin projection is used for constraint reduction, and a hyper-reduction that couples the Petrov--Galerkin projection and a gappy reconstruction is applied for the nonlinearity treatment. The hyper-reduction method is a Gauss--Newton framework with approximated tensors (GNAT), and the main contribution of this study is the presentation of a procedure for applying the method to subsurface flow simulation. A fully implicit oil/water two-phase subsurface flow model in 3D space is considered, and the application of the proposed hyper-reduced-order modeling procedure achieves a runtime speedup of more than 300 relative to the full-order method, which cannot be achieved when only constraint reduction is adopted."

  abstract="This study develops a full Bayesian GEV distribution estimation method (BAYBETA), which contains a semi-Bayesian framework of generalized maximum likelihood estimator (GMLE), to make full use of several advantages of the Bayesian approach especially in uncertainty analysis. For the full Bayesian framework, the optimal hyperparameter of beta prior distribution on the shape parameter of the GEV distribution is found as (6.4990, 8.7927) through simulation-based analysis. In a performance comparison analysis, the performances of BAYBETA, which adopts beta(6.4990, 8.7927) as prior density on the shape parameter of the GEV distribution, are almost the same as or slightly better than GML, outperforming MOM, ML, and LM in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) and bias when the shape parameter is negative. Also, a case study of two hydrologic extreme value data shows that the traditional uncertainty analysis using asymptotic approximation of ML and GML has limitations in describing the uncertainty in high upper quantiles, while the proposed full Bayesian estimation method BAYBETA provides a consistent and complete description of the uncertainty."
