    <p>Mxing and reaction in rough channel flows govern various applications in engineering and natural processes such as microfluidic mixers and fracture flows, where channel wall roughness and flow inertia can vary widely. The combined effects of channel roughness and flow inertia induce complex flow structures such as recirculating flows; along with diffusion-reaction processes, leading to a wide range of reactive transport behaviors. Currently, we lack a mechanistic understanding of mixing-induced reactive transport in rough channel flows. To establish a comprehensive understanding of bimolecular reactive transport in rough channel flows, we conduct a simulation-based study with varying channel roughness, Reynolds number (Re), and Péclet number (Pe). The simulation results reveal the distinctive effects of roughness, inertia (Re), and diffusion (Pe) on reactive transport. It is found that first passage time distributions between conservative and reactive tracers are significantly different, especially in mixing-limited pre-asymptotic regimes. The interplay between roughness and inertia leads to complex flow structures, which determines a spatially heterogeneous fluid stretching field. We show that the fluid stretching field together with solute diffusion leads to a spatially non-uniform chemical reactivity field, and the non-uniform chemical reactivity explains the distinguishing transport behaviors between conservative and reactive tracers. Further, we characterize the non-uniform reactivity with a reaction probability model that is parameterized with Lagrangian velocity magnitudes. Finally, we upscale reactive transport by incorporating the velocity-dependent reaction model into a spatial Markov model.</p>

    <p>We study the reactive displacement of two miscible fluids in channel flows and establish a quantitative link between fluid stretching and chemical reactivity. At the mixing interface, the two fluids react according to the instantaneous irreversible bimolecular reaction A+B→ C. We simulate the advection–diffusion–reaction problem using a random walk based reactive particle method that is free of numerical dispersion. The relative contributions of stretching and diffusion to mixing-limited reaction is controlled by changing the Péclet number, and the channel roughness is also systematically varied. We observe optimal ranges of fluid stretching that maximize reactivity, which are captured by a Lagrangian stretching measure based on an effective time period that honours the stretching history. We show that the optimality originates from the competition between the enhanced mixing by fluid stretching and the mass depletion of the reactants. We analytically derive the spatial distribution of reaction products using a lamellar formulation and successfully predict the optimal ranges of fluid stretching, which are consistent across different levels of channel roughness. These findings provide a mechanistic understanding of how the interplay between fluid stretching, diffusion and channel roughness controls mixing-limited reactions in rough channel flows, and show how reaction hot spots can be predicted from the concept of optimal fluid stretching.</p>

    <p>We study how the complex interplay between channel roughness, inertia, and diffusion controls tracer transport in rough channel flows. We first simulate flow and tracer transport over wide ranges of channel roughness, Reynolds number (Re), and Péclet number (Pe) observable in nature. Pe exerts a first-order control on first-passage time distributions, and the effect of roughness on the tracer transport becomes evident as Re increases. The interplay between the roughness and Re causes recirculating flows, which intensify or suppress anomalous transport depending on Pe. At infinite Pe, the late-time scaling follows a universal power-law scaling, which is explained by conducting a scaling analysis. With extensive numerical simulations and stochastic modeling, we show that the roughness, inertia, and diffusion effects are encoded in Lagrangian velocity statistics represented by velocity distribution and velocity correlation. We successfully reproduce anomalous transport using an upscaled stochastic model that honors the key Lagrangian velocity statistics.</p>

    <p>Predicting variable-density flow and transport in aquifers is critical for the management of many coastal saline aquifers. Accurate characterization of hydrogeological parameters is critical for prediction, and the characterization is often conducted by assimilating data into models. However, few studies have investigated the underlying physics controlling the value-of-information (VOI) of data for aquifer characterization. In this study, we show how a greater understanding of the underlying physics controlling pressure and concentration data coupling can lead to improved characterization. In variable-density flow, the key physics that controls the VOI of pressure and concentration data is the non-linear coupling between flow and transport via fluid density which causes the pressure field to experience transient changes according to the evolution of salinity distribution. We first demonstrate the coupling between pressure and concentration data using information theory, and then systematically investigate how the variable-density flow impacts the VOI of these data in relation to permeability estimation. Using an ensemble Kalman filter, we estimate the permeability field of saline aquifer systems in two scenarios of data usage: pressure data only, and pressure and concentration data jointly. This study demonstrates that, regardless of the data usage scenario, the maximum VOI of data is obtained when free convection and forced convection are balanced. We further show that the advantage of joint inversion of pressure and concentration data decreases as the coupling effect between flow and transport increases. Finally, we study how the level of permeability field heterogeneity affects the coupling, which in turn controls VOI of pressure and concentration data.</p>

    <p>The injection and storage of freshwater in saline aquifers for the purpose of managed aquifer recharge is an important technology that can help ensure sustainable water resources. As a result of the density difference between the injected freshwater and ambient saline groundwater, the pressure field is coupled to the spatial salinity distribution, and therefore experiences transient changes. The effect of variable density can be quantified by the mixed convection ratio, which is a ratio between the strength of two convection processes: free convection due to the density differences and forced convection due to hydraulic gradients. We combine a density-dependent flow and transport simulator with an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to analyze the effects of freshwater injection rates on the value-of-information of transient pressure data for saline aquifer characterization. The EnKF is applied to sequentially estimate heterogeneous aquifer permeability fields using real-time pressure data. The performance of the permeability estimation is analyzed in terms of the accuracy and the uncertainty of the estimated permeability fields as well as the predictability of breakthrough curve arrival times in a realistic push-pull setting. This study demonstrates that injecting fluids at a rate that balances the two characteristic convections can maximize the value of pressure data for saline aquifer characterization.</p>

    <p>Subsurface flow modeling is an indispensable task for reservoir management, but the associated computational cost is burdensome because of model complexity and the fact that many simulation runs are required for its applications such as production optimization, uncertainty quantification, and history matching. To relieve the computational burden in reservoir flow modeling, a reduced-order modeling procedure based on hyper-reduction is presented. The procedure consists of three components: state reduction, constraint reduction, and nonlinearity treatment. State reduction based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is considered, and the impact of state reduction, with different strategies for collecting snapshots, on accuracy and predictability is investigated. Petrov–Galerkin projection is used for constraint reduction, and a hyper-reduction that couples the Petrov–Galerkin projection and a gappy reconstruction is applied for the nonlinearity treatment. The hyper-reduction method is a Gauss–Newton framework with approximated tensors (GNAT), and the main contribution of this study is the presentation of a procedure for applying the method to subsurface flow simulation. A fully implicit oil/water two-phase subsurface flow model in 3D space is considered, and the application of the proposed hyper-reduced-order modeling procedure achieves a runtime speedup of more than 300 relative to the full-order method, which cannot be achieved when only constraint reduction is adopted.</p>

  <span class="abstract hidden">
    <p>This study develops a full Bayesian GEV distribution estimation method (BAYBETA), which contains a semi-Bayesian framework of generalized maximum likelihood estimator (GMLE), to make full use of several advantages of the Bayesian approach especially in uncertainty analysis. For the full Bayesian framework, the optimal hyperparameter of beta prior distribution on the shape parameter of the GEV distribution is found as (6.4990, 8.7927) through simulation-based analysis. In a performance comparison analysis, the performances of BAYBETA, which adopts beta(6.4990, 8.7927) as prior density on the shape parameter of the GEV distribution, are almost the same as or slightly better than GML, outperforming MOM, ML, and LM in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) and bias when the shape parameter is negative. Also, a case study of two hydrologic extreme value data shows that the traditional uncertainty analysis using asymptotic approximation of ML and GML has limitations in describing the uncertainty in high upper quantiles, while the proposed full Bayesian estimation method BAYBETA provides a consistent and complete description of the uncertainty.</p>
